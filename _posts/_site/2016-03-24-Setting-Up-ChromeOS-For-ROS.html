<p>This post will be focused on listing the preliminary setup requied to facilitate ROS on Chromebooks. The Chromebook that I will be using through this post will be a c720 (2gb/2995U).</p>

<p>To start it is important to discuss the different options that are offered to Chromebooks for running Linux. If your are just getting into the Chromebook lineup, you probably have heard about Chrubuntu and Crouton. Here are my 2cents on the differnce:

#Chrubuntu<br />
Chrubuntu is essentially a hack to bring any Linux distro of your choice in replacement of ChromeOS that comes with your chromebook. I have used this for the longest time in the past and it has caused me more problems than not. Particularily hardware compatibiltiy is the primary concern. From fixing the trackpad to optimizing chrome on a clean linux install, its just not worth the effort in my personal opinion.

Crouton stands for ChRomium Os Universal chrooT envirONment. Understanding crouton from the surface is that you are essentially running ChromeOS parallel to a distro of your choice. I resorted to Crouton again after a whole year of Chrubuntu simply because I was sick of dealing with the trackpad and processor problems after os updates with Chrubuntu.

<p>In the end of the day, what I am left with all the benefits of optimized software from Chromebook and the power of a fully functional linux distro. Besides, having a chromeOS operating a robot is hilarious.</p>
