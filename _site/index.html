        Continuing from the previous post, this post is going to describe the implementation of the actual radio.

        </h2>
        As part of a project course over the summer, we were tasked to build a self-powered AM radio with easy assembly. The motivations were as follows:

  Easy assembly allows good education material for younger children
  Self-powering allows for use during emergency situations
  There is good AM radio coverage in the Vancouver area
  FM radios are slightly more complicated than AM radio

         Recently I've been reached out via email, A2A about the function of ROS. For people who are new to ROS, it is hard to grasp what ROS is and why we need it. Below is a copy of the question, link to the question, and my answer.

        Since the primary work I do is interfacing ROS with microcontrollers for sensor/actuator controls, I would like to share a problem that you may often encounter when doing any time of data transmission.

        This post will be focused on listing the preliminary setup requied to facilitate ROS on Chromebooks. The Chromebook that I will be using through this post will be a c720 (2gb/2995U).

        After purging my old setup for the blog since it was empty and gross, I decide to start the fresh blog with an useful post. After 9 hours of testing and tweaking I finally removed chrubuntu from my c720 and installed crouton with xfce::ubuntu14.04 (Which is very important as ROS-indigo does not support 10.2 which is default with crouton)
